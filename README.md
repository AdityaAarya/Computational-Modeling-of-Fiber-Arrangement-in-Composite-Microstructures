# Computational-Modeling-of-Fiber-Arrangement-in-Composite-Microstructures
This project explores the uniformity of fiber distribution within a composite material using MATLAB. The main objective is to simulate the random placement of fibers within a defined area and analyze key statistical properties, specifically the inter-fiber spacing, as a function of the composite's volume fraction (Vf)
